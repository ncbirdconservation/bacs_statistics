###Introduction

This study was initiated in 2011 with the following objectives:
1.	Determine the present distribution of potential habitat areas within the historic range of Bachman’s sparrow in North Carolina
2.	Determine the present state-wide breeding distribution and relative abundance of Bachman’s sparrow in North Carolina
3.	Document habitat associations of Bachman’s sparrow in NC
4.	Provide technical guidance to landowners and land managers with potential to support Bachman’s sparrow
5.	Develop a state-wide conservation plan for Bachman’s sparrow

Methods
The current Bachman’s sparrow distribution and status is being assessed across the historic range in North Carolina.  This range was defined by the GAP predicted distribution and historic records.  Historic records were compiled from the NC Natural Heritage Program, NC Museum of Natural Sciences, NC Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC), US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Geological Survey Breeding Bird Survey, North Carolina State University, and ebird.  
Surveys are conducted at 3 types of points.  One is historic Bachman’s sparrow observations from 2005 or before (records from 2006 to present are assumed to still be extant).  The second is potential Bachman’s sparrow habitat areas identified in GIS.  The third is locations with high potential habitat identified in the field and not otherwise selected by GIS or historic records.  
To select survey points in GIS, the historic range was divided into 1,482 grids using 3,952 ha (9,765 ac) US Geological Survey quarter quads.  These grids were examined in GIS using 2011 aerial photography and data layers which may indicate the presence of Bachman’s sparrow habitat.  One layer was the NC Natural Heritage Program’s Wet-Xeric Longleaf-Wiregrass Woodland landscape habitat indicator guild.  This layer represents areas where there are records of indicator species closely associated with longleaf woodland habitat as well as contiguous areas with suitable habitat.  We also used the Potential Upland Habitats layer created by the NC Sandhills Conservation Partnership which indicates areas identified by aerial photographs which appear to have longleaf pine trees and no evidence of ground disturbance, such as bedding, but those sites had not been ground-truthed.  Finally, we used the GAP predicted distribution for Bachman’s sparrow.  We used the NC Natural Heritage Program’s Managed Areas layer to indicate which properties (both public and private) may be more likely to be managed for wildlife habitat.  
For all these data layers and for other areas within the selected grids, we examined the aerial photograph at approximately a 1:12,000 to 1:16,000 scale and assessed whether there appeared to be open pine woodland, clearcut, old field, or powerline right-of-way habitat.  In locations where there appeared to be potential habitat in a patch of at least ~50 acres (we adjusted the patch size threshold depending on landscape context), we placed a survey point, regardless of land ownership.  We attempted to place points in locations where we could maximize detection of birds in the patch, and also to facilitate access.  Points were placed at least 500m apart, up to a maximum of 16 points per grid.
We randomly selected 25% of the grids in the eastern Piedmont, Sandhills and southern Coastal Plain to initially assess for potential habitat.  We later assessed all the remaining grids in the Sandhills and Southern Coastal Plain plus some additional grids in the eastern Piedmont that had the highest potential for habitat.  The later assessment was informed by the results of our initial survey work.  The earlier assessment of randomly selected grids was more inclusive of potential habitat areas while the later assessment was more discriminatory and avoided smaller habitat patches and those that were more likely to have marginal habitat.
As of January 2014 we identified xxxx potential survey points.  X points had clearcut habitat within 200m, x points had powerline habitat, and x points had open pine woodland habitat.  A point could have more than one habitat type within 200m.
We secured permission to survey from public land managers and reached out to a total of 270 private landowners via letters and personal contacts.  Overall, 139 private landowners granted permission, 29 denied permission, and we got no response from 102. 
Personal contacts was the most effective way of securing private landowner permission.  We asked permission via phone and in person from landowners that we know and asked permission through other natural resource professionals with landowner relationships. We had particular success with the US Fish and Wildlife Service Safe Harbor program and the NCWRC Corporate Cooperative Upland habitat Restoration and Enhancement (CURE) program.  These 71 personal contacts yielded 63 yes (89%), 4 no (6%), and 4 no response (6%).
We sent out letters to 199 landowners and 76 of them (38%) granted us permission to conduct a survey, 25 denied permission (13%), and 98 had no response (49%).   In the Southern Coastal Plain we followed up with email or phone calls to non-respondents, and this increased our response rate.  We sent 97 letters and had a total of 43 (44%) landowners grant permission, 18 (19%) say no, and 36 (37%) no response.  In the Sandhills we did not follow up with every non-respondent.  We sent 102 letters and 33 (32%) landowners said yes, 7 (7%) said no, and 62 (61%) no response. 
We ground-truthed the habitat at points for historic Bachman’s sparrow locations and GIS selected points which were publically accessible or where we had permission.  Point count surveys were conducted at points with suitable habitat, defined as at least 4 acres within view with >20% native herbaceous groundcover (“clump grasses” and forbs) >10 inches tall.  If better habitat was present nearby the point could be moved up to 150m to maximize coverage of good habitat.  For points that were rejected due to insufficient habitat, we recorded the reasons (e.g. closed canopy, fire suppression, land use change, etc).
While in the field, if we encountered a large patch of high quality habitat >500m from other survey points, a point was added in the field.  We took a digital photo of each survey point (including rejected points) showing a representative image of the habitat available.
Point count surveys were conducted between first light and 11:00am on mornings without precipitation, and wind <10mph. The survey consisted of 4 minutes of passive listening followed by a 4 minute period of Bachman’s sparrow song interspersed with silence, with aggressive chip notes and song played at the end.  In addition to Bachman’s sparrows, we also recorded counts of 7 other priority species associated with fire-managed longleaf pine habitat (Table 1).
